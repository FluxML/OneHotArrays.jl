    onehot(x, labels, [default])

Returns a [`OneHotVector`](@ref) which is roughly a sparse representation of `x .== labels`.

Instead of storing say `Vector{Bool}`, it stores the index of the first occurrence 
of `x` in `labels`. If `x` is not found in labels, then it either returns `onehot(default, labels)`,
or gives an error if no default is given.

See also [`onehotbatch`](@ref) to apply this to many `x`s, 
and [`onecold`](@ref) to reverse either of these, as well as to generalise `argmax`.

# Examples

3-element OneHotVector(::UInt32) with eltype Bool:
 ⋅

julia> αβγ = (onehot(0, 0:2), β, onehot(:z, [:a, :b, :c], :c))  # uses default
(Bool[1, 0, 0], Bool[0, 1, 0], Bool[0, 0, 1])

julia> hcat(αβγ...)  # preserves sparsity

"""
    onehotbatch(xs, labels, [default])

Returns a [`OneHotMatrix`](@ref) where `k`th column of the matrix is [`onehot(xs[k], labels)`](@ref onehot).
This is a sparse matrix, which stores just a `Vector{UInt32}` containing the indices of the
nonzero elements.

If one of the inputs in `xs` is not found in `labels`, that column is `onehot(default, labels)`
if `default` is given, else an error.

If `xs` has more dimensions, `N = ndims(xs) > 1`, then the result is an 
`AbstractArray{Bool, N+1}` which is one-hot along the first dimension, 
i.e. `result[:, k...] == onehot(xs[k...], labels)`.

Note that `xs` can be any iterable, such as a string. And that using a tuple
for `labels` will often speed up construction, certainly for less than 32 classes.

"""
    onecold(y::AbstractArray, labels = 1:size(y,1))

Roughly the inverse operation of [`onehot`](@ref) or [`onehotbatch`](@ref): 
This finds the index of the largest element of `y`, or each column of `y`, 
and looks them up in `labels`.

If `labels` are not specified, the default is integers `1:size(y,1)` --
the same operation as `argmax(y, dims=1)` but sometimes a different return type.
